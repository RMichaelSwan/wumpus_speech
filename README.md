# Hunt The Wumpus!

Play interactively or build your own program to hunt the wumpus.

# Play a game
Download and run wumpus_interactive.py (you will also need to download standard.txt to get the standard map). This will let you play the classic game on the standard map. Here are the instructions taken from the BASIC source code. The original BASIC source code is also in the repo if you want to take a look or run the original code. It's amazing how small it is! It's in wumpus.basic

       WELCOME TO 'HUNT THE WUMPUS'

        THE WUMPUS LIVES IN A CAVE OF 20 ROOMS: EACH ROOM HAS 3 TUNNELS LEADING TO OTHER
        ROOMS. THE STANDARD MAP IS A DODECAHEDRON (IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A
        DODECAHEDRON IS, ASK SOMEONE)

        ***
        HAZARDS:

        BOTTOMLESS PITS - TWO ROOMS HAVE BOTTOMLESS PITS IN THEM
        IF YOU GO THERE: YOU FALL INTO THE PIT (& LOSE!)

        SUPER BATS  - TWO OTHER ROOMS HAVE SUPER BATS. IF YOU GO THERE, A BAT GRABS YOU
        AND TAKES YOU TO SOME OTHER ROOM AT RANDOM. (WHICH MIGHT BE TROUBLESOME)

        WUMPUS:

        THE WUMPUS IS NOT BOTHERED BY THE HAZARDS (HE HAS SUCKER FEET AND IS TOO BIG FOR
        A BAT TO LIFT). USUALLY HE IS ASLEEP. TWO THINGS WAKE HIM UP: YOUR ENTERING HIS
        ROOM OR YOUR SHOOTING AN ARROW.

            IF THE WUMPUS WAKES, HE EATS YOU IF YOU ARE THERE, OTHERWISE, HE MOVES (P=0.75)
        ONE ROOM OR STAYS STILL (P=0.25). AFTER THAT, IF HE IS WHERE YOU ARE, HE EATS
        YOU UP (& YOU LOSE!)


        YOU:

        EACH TURN YOU MAY MOVE OR SHOOT A CROOKED ARROW
        MOVING: YOU CAN GO ONE ROOM (THRU ONE TUNNEL)
        ARROWS: YOU HAVE 5 ARROWS. YOU LOSE WHEN YOU RUN OUT.

            EACH ARROW CAN GO FROM 1 TO 5 ROOMS: YOU AIM BY TELLING THE COMPUTER THE ROOMS
        YOU WANT THE ARROW TO GO TO. IF THE ARROW CAN'T GO THAT WAY (IE NO TUNNEL) IT
        MOVES AT RANDOM TO THE NEXT ROOM.

            IF THE ARROW HITS THE WUMPUS: YOU WIN.

            IF THE ARROW HITS YOU: YOU LOSE.

            WARNINGS:

        WHEN YOU ARE ONE ROOM AWAY FROM WUMPUS OR HAZARD, THE COMPUTER SAYS:

        WUMPUS - 'I SMELL A WUMPUS'

        BAT - 'I HEAR BATS'

        PIT - 'I FEEL A DRAFT'

The wumpus game has been modified a little from the original for this event, perhaps the most visible difference is the addition of a score. Getting killed results in a score of 0, while winning results in a score of 100 minus the number of moves taken. Shooting is free. If you shoot the wumpus without moving from your starting location you will get a score of 100.

# Play the game
Run `python wumpus_interactive.py` and play the classic game for yourself. See if you can figure out a good strategy. How often do you win or lose? What information are you keeping track of?

What does the map look like? Every room has three exits and the map "is a dodecahedron." A dodecahedron has 12 faces and 20 vertices. The vertices correspond to the rooms. The shape can be flattened to make it easier to visualize. Open up Standard.pdf to see a flattened dodecahedron.

# Time to bring in the computer!
After you have played a game or two yourself, you're ready to write your own wumpus hunting program. Open up wumpus_ai.py and take a look at status_callback() which tells you about your current situation and perform_move and perform_shoot which are the two actions you can take. The wumpus_ui.py file is similar but asks the user to input the decisions. The status_callback method is called from the game host, so don't add or remove parameters, but perform_move and perform_shoot can be altered and you can also add more members to the Player object itself to keep track of the rooms you've visited and where the wumpus might be located. The room numbers will range from 0-19 (the ui adds one to make it 1-based for humans, but 0-based is nicer for computers).

# Wait, is it already working?
The existing wumpus_ai.py file already works - it uses the random module to make the decisions. It also plays 100 games so you can see how well it performs on average: about 2,500 out of a possible 10,000. Even blundering about, it does ok.

# Turning on Graphics
The wumpushost file can show a graphic representation of the game. Try turning it on for the wumpus_ai.py file. Look for this line `WumpusHost(a_seed, map_file, show_graphics=False, delay=3)` where you can turn on show_graphics and adjust how many seconds to pause between moves.

# Running on different maps
Included in the directory is the standard map and some new maps (m√∂bius strip, water slide, and Risk(r)). Each map has a PDF file showing what it looks like. Do not assume the map numbering will remain constant from run to run. That is, use the data given to you from status_callback to gradually fill in your world view instead of reading the map files directly. We reserve the right to randomize the room labels before starting the game! You _can_ assume there will always be 20 rooms and each room has 3 ways out. There will always be 2 pits, 2 bats, and 1 wumpus.

# Submission
For the event your code will be run on the standard map, one of the custom maps, and one map you have not seen yet. All programs will be run with the same maps and random seed ranges. Programs that reach 4000+ point average on the 3 maps are winners.
